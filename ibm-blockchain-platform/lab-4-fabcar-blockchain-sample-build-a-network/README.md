## Structure of the Network

![Sample basic network structure](../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2825%29.png)

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/blockchain/howto/ibp-console-build-network.html#ibp-console-build-network). This will include creating a channel with a single peer organization with its own MSP and CA \(Certificate Authority\), and an orderer organization with its own MSP and CA. We will create the respective identities to deploy peers and operate nodes.
