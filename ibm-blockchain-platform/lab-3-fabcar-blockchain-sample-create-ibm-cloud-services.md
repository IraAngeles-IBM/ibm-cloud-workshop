# Lab 3: FabCar Blockchain Sample - Create IBM Cloud Kubernetes services

Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/infrastructure/containers-kubernetes). You can find the service in the `Catalog`. For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name. Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster and expires after 30 days.
