# Business blockchain concepts

A _**business blockchain network**_ is a decentralized network that uses distributed ledger technology \(DLT\) for the efficient and secure transfer of business assets between member organizations in the network. Assets can be physical or digital, such as vehicles, diamonds, fresh produce, or insurance records. A shared, _**distributed ledger**_ records an immutable history of all asset transactions between participants in the network, and catalogs the current state \(world state\) of those assets. The business rules that govern transactions are agreed upon by members and encapsulated in **smart contracts**.

Instead of relying on a central authority or trusted intermediary, such as a bank or brokerage firm, to validate transactions, members of a blockchain network use a _**consensus**_ mechanism to improve transaction processing speed, transparency, and accountability across the network. For additional confidentiality, members join one or more _**channels**_ that allow for data isolation; a channel-specific ledger is shared by the authenticated peers in that channel.

A blockchain network for business is collectively owned and operated by a group of identifiable and verifiable institutions, such as businesses, universities, or hospitals. In such a _**permissioned network**_, the participants are known to each other, and transactions are processed much faster than in a non-permissioned, public network like the Bitcoin network. In the Bitcoin network, members are anonymous, forcing the reliance on “proof-of-work” and other types of consensus mechanisms that require time-consuming computations to confirm identities and validate transactions.
